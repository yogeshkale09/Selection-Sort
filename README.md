# Selection-Sort
This sorting technique repeatedly finds the minimum element and sort it in order. Bubble Sort does not occupy any extra memory space. During the execution of this algorithm, two subarrays are maintained, the subarray which is already sorted, and the remaining subarray which is unsorted.
